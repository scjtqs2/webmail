# Changelog

## 1.13.0 (2026-10-07)

1.13.0 turns the vacation settings into an Out of Office page that can also forward mail, lets filter rules run only for a date range, and copies messages into another connected account. Files from the Files app can be attached in the composer, tags can be set on many messages at once and folders moved in bulk. Messages whose sender can't be verified now carry a warning. It also stops one account's settings and templates from carrying over to the next account signed in on the same browser.

### Security

- **Settings**: Signing out and then signing in with another account in the same browser no longer shows the previous account's settings, tags and templates, and no longer saves them to the new account's synced settings (#1185)

### Features

- **Mail**: A message whose sender fails the From domain's checks, or that passes neither SPF nor DKIM, shows a warning above the message and a badge next to the sender. "Always trust this sender" is not offered for it
- **Mail**: "Copy to account..." in the message menu files a copy in a folder of another connected account and leaves the original where it is. Copies keep their original date (#1150, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Mail**: The selection toolbar and the right-click menu put a tag on, or take it off, every selected message at once (#1077)
- **Out of office**: The vacation settings are now an Out of Office page: the period on top, then the automatic reply and forwarding, each with its own switch. Forwarding works with or without the reply, never forwards spam and can keep a copy in the inbox. The reply can go to all senders, internal senders only or external senders only (#1152, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Filters**: A rule can be limited to a period, and the rule list shows whether it is scheduled, active or expired (#1152, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Filters**: The new "All messages" condition matches every message (#1154, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Composer**: "Attach from Files" attaches files from the Files app, including files shared with you, without downloading and uploading them again (#1179)
- **Composer**: Typing @ in the message body offers the To and Cc recipients and inserts the chosen one's first name. Bcc recipients are never offered. "Mention recipients with @" in the composer settings turns it off (#1134, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Folders**: The folder settings can select several folders, with Shift+click for a range, and move them together under another folder or to the top level (#1173)
- **Calendar**: The day and week views can be limited to working hours, and the week view can leave out non-working days. Events outside the visible hours are counted at the top and bottom of each day and open from there, and a button in the view shows all hours (#1164)
- **Login**: `LOGIN_SHOW_TOKEN_LOGIN=true` offers "Sign in with an access token", for JMAP servers that take API tokens instead of passwords, such as Fastmail
- **Login**: A server in `JMAP_SERVERS` whose `oauth` block has both a `clientId` and a `buttonLabel` gets its own sign-in button on the login page, even while OAuth is off globally. This allows a "Sign in with Google" button for a Gmail bridge next to servers that use passwords (#1135, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **UI**: The browser tab title names the active account, as in "Inbox - alice@example.com - Webmail", and Settings, Calendar, Contacts and Files set their own title. Turning off "Subject in Tab Title" under Admin > Policy keeps message subjects out of the title, and with it out of the browser history (#1186, thanks @oguzyilmaznet)
- **Unified**: While logins reconnect after a page load, the "All accounts" header shows how many are already counted, such as "4/10" (#1140, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Push**: A message that reaches several of your accounts rings once. For 30 seconds after an alert, notifications from your other accounts arrive silently (#1141, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Server**: `SOURCE_CODE_URL` points the source code link in Settings > About at the code of a modified build, as AGPL section 13 asks of anyone running one (#1161)

### Changes

- **Calendar**: The day and week views show 08:00 to 20:00 by default. "Limit visible hours" in the calendar settings changes the range or turns it off (#1164)
- **Tags**: Tag views and their counts leave out messages in Trash and Spam (#1156)
- **Mail**: In a shared mailbox, the Move menus list that mailbox's folders first and your own folders after them, under your account name (#1149)
- **Dependencies**: sharp 0.35.5 and source-map-js 1.2.2 (npm audit)
- **Docs**: CONTRIBUTING.md explains what belongs in core and what in a plugin, and which changes need an agreed issue before a pull request

### Fixes

- **Mail**: Attachments, inline images and .eml downloads of messages in shared folders are fetched from the account that owns them. On Cyrus they failed with "failed to find blob by id" (#1188, thanks @VasilisNtovolos)
- **Mail**: Archive creates an Archive folder when the account has none, instead of only reporting that it is missing (#1176, thanks @cybersmurf)
- **Mail**: Opening the webmail starts in the inbox instead of a folder from an earlier visit, such as Trash
- **Mail**: Opening another folder, tag, account or search starts the message list at the top instead of where the last one was scrolled to (#1138, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Mail**: Previews no longer start with a style sheet ("@media screen and ...") in the message list and in push notifications (#1136, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Search**: Searching from the unified All mail view finds sent mail too
- **Send**: A draft saved without a subject reopens with an empty subject, so Send warns about it again instead of sending "(No Subject)" (#1189)
- **Send**: When the server does not confirm that a message was sent, the draft is kept and the composer asks you to check Sent before sending again (#1019, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Send**: A message the server refuses shows the server's reason instead of "Invalid reference to non-existing object"
- **Send**: A forward sent from another account's address no longer fails with `blobNotFound`. Its attachments and inline images are copied to the sending account first (#1142, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Push**: Push turns itself back on when the browser lost its subscription, retrying at most every 15 minutes (#1147, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Push**: The notification settings check push again when you come back to the tab, so push turned off in the browser or another tab no longer shows as on (#1148, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Push**: When the new message cannot be read, the notification no longer announces another unread message from the Inbox in its place, and a failed lookup shows a generic notification instead of none (#1041, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Filters**: "Stop processing further rules" also stops after "Delete silently" and "Reject", so later rules no longer file the message. Rules whose name contains double spaces, a tab or a trailing space no longer gain a copy on every save, and the copies earlier saves left are removed (#1153, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Filters**: The forwarding limit counts the forwards one message can collect, instead of adding up every enabled rule, and warns when the rule order lets one message go over it (#1155, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Filters**: A condition with several values wraps inside its card in the expanded rule view (#1139, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Filters**: An open rule dialog or Sieve editor, and what was typed in it, survives a filter change from another tab or device (#1162, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Templates**: A tab or device that had not reloaded no longer deletes templates created elsewhere when it saves its settings
- **Calendar**: Duplicating an event keeps its meeting link (#1170)
- **Calendar**: The Calendar Agenda plugin shows events from shared and group calendars (#1175, thanks @cybersmurf)
- **Files**: Folders shared with you can be opened, and your own folders shared, in both folder layouts (#1181)
- **Files**: Office editing works behind a reverse proxy where the editor and the browser reach the webmail at different addresses. The WOPI client URL may be an internal address (#1130)
- **Login**: When Stalwart accepts a password and TOTP code but refuses to issue tokens, the login page points at the OAuth client settings instead of opening the browser's own sign-in dialog and reporting a wrong code
- **Branding**: With `APP_NAME` set, the authenticator app entry for two-factor sign-in, the About card and the Files preview use the configured name and logo (#1177, thanks @cybersmurf)
- **UI**: Text fields in dialogs keep the focus when the page behind updates, which happened every 30 seconds and on new mail (#1162, thanks @dealerweb)
- **UI**: Buttons, menu items, tabs and other controls show the pointer cursor again (#1184, thanks @gwku)
- **UI**: The account group labels in the From dropdown are readable in dark themes (#1157, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Translations**: Czech is fully translated (#1174, thanks @cybersmurf), and missing placeholders are restored in Persian, Hebrew, Hungarian, Mongolian and Slovak (#1165, thanks @owgreen-dev)

## 1.12.0 (2026-09-30)

1.12.0 lets you create filter rules straight from a message, offers the code from sign-in mail for one-click copying, and gives a phone linked with "Link Mobile App" a sign-in of its own, for every kind of account. Search now leaves Spam and Trash out by default, and emptying an ordinary folder moves its mail to the Trash. Browsers with many logins start up much faster. It also contains three security fixes, so please update.

### Security

- **Auth**: The password+TOTP login no longer sends the webmail's OAuth client secret to a mail server the user chose when custom JMAP endpoints are allowed. Only admin-configured servers get it
- **Auth**: The identity provider round trip for "Link Mobile App" can no longer sign the browser in as whichever account answered it, and a re-authentication the provider answered from an existing session instead of a fresh login is refused
- **Mail**: Opening a previewed SVG attachment in a new tab no longer runs the sender's script in the webmail origin

### Features

- **Mail**: A "Rules" entry in the message right-click menu creates filter rules from the message: always move mail from its sender, domain or mailing list, mark it read, tag it, or block the sender. A new rule can also run on the messages already in the folder, and it can be undone from the toast
- **Filters**: The rule editor suggests conditions from the message it was opened from (subject, recipients, List-Id, sender domain), and the new "is the address" and "has the domain" conditions match an address exactly
- **Mail**: Codes from sign-in and confirmation mail show as a copy chip in the message, and in the list for a day. "Show Verification Codes" in settings turns it off
- **Mail**: In the unified view, rows can be tinted with their account's color instead of showing the account dot, and tags this browser has no definition for, such as ones set by a server-side filter, get a color of their own instead of grey (#1052, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Search**: The folder dropdown shows subfolders indented under their parents
- **Composer**: Pasted plain-text lines that start with "- ", "* ", "• ", "1. " or "1) " become real lists
- **Calendar**: The event popover finds the join link of Teams, Zoom, Meet, Webex, Jitsi, Whereby and GoTo meetings in the location or description, and the location opens in maps, with a copy button next to it (#1095, thanks @lucletoffe)
- **Server**: `LIBRETRANSLATE_API_KEY_FILE`, `BULWARK_JWT_AUTH_SECRET_FILE`, `BULWARK_STALWART_MASTER_USER_FILE` and `BULWARK_STALWART_MASTER_PASSWORD_FILE` read these secrets from files, and the admin config accepts `oauthClientSecretFile` and `sessionSecretFile` (#897, thanks @Cameo007)
- **Plugins**: `PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` points at an existing Ed25519 key for signing managed plugin bundles, for read-only secret mounts (#996, thanks @mulatta)
- **Releases**: Container images and release files come with a signed build provenance attestation, and the standalone tarballs get a `.sha256`. The README explains how to check them with `gh attestation verify`

### Changes

- **Search**: Search leaves out Spam and Trash unless "All folders" is picked in the folder dropdown. A search started in Spam or Trash searches that folder
- **Mail**: Emptying a folder other than Trash or Junk moves its mail to the Trash, unless deleted mail is set to be removed permanently
- **Mobile app**: "Link Mobile App" is offered for every account. Password and password+TOTP accounts confirm their password (and code) in the dialog. The phone gets a sign-in of its own, so signing out in the browser no longer signs it out, and a sign-in link to copy sits next to the QR code. Failed password attempts are limited per account
- **Calendar**: Events are drawn as solid blocks of their calendar's color; declined and cancelled events are outlined
- **UI**: Success and info toasts are plain cards; only errors and warnings are colored
- **Performance**: With many logins, the browser restores them four at a time and no longer reloads every login's folders, identities and push connections each time one of them connects (#1132, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **License**: An additional permission under section 7 of the AGPL allows distributing apps built from this code through app stores. It is provisional until every earlier contributor has agreed ([consent request](https://github.com/orgs/bulwarkmail/discussions/1113)) and applies in full to contributions made since 30 September 2026
- **Docs**: Guidelines for AI-assisted contributions in the README and CONTRIBUTING.md

### Fixes

- **Mail**: Clicking a folder's unread count lists only that folder's unread mail, not unread mail from every folder of every account
- **Mail**: In "unread first" lists, a message you open stays in place until you open another
- **Mail**: The message list no longer flashes a reload right after the page opens
- **Mail**: On tablets, the message list comes back when the reading pane empties, for example after the open message is deleted or moved
- **Mail**: Dividers between rows no longer disappear at 125% or 150% display scaling
- **Mail**: The unread dot is centred on the sender avatar
- **Mail**: Attachments declared with a type the browser cannot show, such as `application/x-as400attachment` from IBM i systems, `application/x-pdf` or a catch-all type, preview according to their file name (#1127, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Send**: Recipients the server refuses at send are reported. When it refuses all of them, the message stays open as not sent; otherwise a warning names the refused ones (#1123)
- **Composer**: The message body stays reachable in short reading panes, such as the bottom reading pane on a laptop (#1114)
- **Composer**: Pasted plain text keeps its blank lines
- **Push**: A notification link waits for a login that is still reconnecting instead of reporting the account as signed out, opens the folder of the right account, and no longer pulls you away from something you opened in the meantime (#1131, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Push**: A browser subscribed with another VAPID key resubscribes on its own, and Firefox can turn push on again when it cannot read its old subscription (#1121, thanks @shukiv)
- **Calendar**: Dragged events no longer disappear: all-day events moved in the month view keep their start, and occurrences of recurring events with a UTC start, as in Google Calendar exports, no longer shift by the time-zone offset (#1119)
- **Calendar**: A failed calendar fetch no longer hides every calendar or leaves only the birthday calendar selected
- **Calendar**: The all-day area of the week view is sized from the visible week, stacks each day's tasks under its all-day events, and collapses to three rows with a toggle (#1122, thanks @sanitz)
- **Calendar**: The Save button shows while an event is saving, and a save refused for its length says so (#921, thanks @texchi2)
- **Calendar**: Invitations no longer carry blank participant names or an empty description (#748, thanks @lucletoffe)
- **Files**: Files shared with you open and save in the office editor (#1094)
- **Files**: Office editing works behind a reverse proxy at a sub-path (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`) (#1101, thanks @dealerweb)
- **Accounts**: Adding a sixth account through server-side SSO no longer overwrites the first account's sign-in
- **Mobile app**: The app's "Sign in via webmail" keeps working past the first token expiry when the webmail uses a confidential OAuth client or an identity provider on another host
- **Admin**: Admin sign-in works over plain HTTP. The admin cookie's Secure flag follows the request, or `COOKIE_SECURE` when it is set (#1063, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Admin**: The OAuth scope fields show the actual default scopes, which do not include `offline_access` (#1126)
- **Lite**: SSO sessions survive a page reload with identity providers such as Rauthy that refuse an early token refresh (#552)
- **UI**: The app retries loading its configuration after a timeout or a failed request instead of staying broken (#1112, thanks @theLucius7)
- **Docker**: The image builds from a remote Git context (#1118)

## 1.11.2 (2026-09-26)

1.11.2 fixes the Docker image and the standalone tarballs of 1.11.1, which did not start. It contains all the security fixes from 1.11.1, so please update.

### Fixes

- **Docker**: The server starts again. 1.11.1 excluded `data/` from the standalone build with a pattern that also dropped Next.js's own metadata modules, so the Docker image and the `bulwark-standalone-*` tarballs failed on startup. `npm start` and Bulwark Lite were not affected

## 1.11.1 (2026-09-26)

1.11.1 is a security and bug-fix release. It fixes four reported vulnerabilities, two of them critical, and the findings of a security audit. Please update.

### Security

- **Admin**: Only a Stalwart superuser gets into the admin dashboard. The admin probe accepted Stalwart's default tenant-admin role, so the administrator of a single tenant was signed into a dashboard that configures the whole instance (GHSA-v6hr-cmxm-pv73, thanks @douwezijlstra-frl)
- **Admin**: Admin status is only taken from an admin-configured server. A context cookie minted while custom JMAP endpoints were allowed let a user-chosen server keep answering the admin probe after the switch was turned off (GHSA-j867-89p4-v8hm, thanks @Vip3r-MC)
- **API**: Cross-origin writes are refused on the JMAP passthrough and every other cookie-authenticated `/api/` route, not only `/api/auth/*`. A page on a same-site sibling origin could run arbitrary JMAP as the signed-in user. The gate also decides on the decoded path, so `/api/%61uth/...` no longer skips it (GHSA-9mvj-98f5-9q6g, thanks @kah-ja)
- **Admin**: Admin sign-in attempts are also capped at 50 per 15 minutes across all clients, because a forged `X-Forwarded-For` got a fresh per-IP budget when no reverse proxy is in front (GHSA-7pj2-232x-6698, thanks @richardweinberger)
- **Admin**: Impersonation no longer puts the Stalwart master password into the session cookie. The webmail creates an app password on the target mailbox that expires after 8 hours and is revoked on sign-out, and a used impersonation link is refused after a restart or on another replica
- **Mail**: A sender can no longer fake a DMARC or DKIM pass in the security badges, with a crafted envelope address or an `Authentication-Results` header of their own
- **Mail**: Opening an SVG attachment's thumbnail on its own no longer runs the sender's script in the webmail origin
- **Mail**: Remote content stays blocked in the mobile conversation view, the `.eml` attachment preview, the quoted original of a reply or forward, the print view, and for URL spellings the filter missed (backslashes, CSS escapes, `image-set()`)
- **Mail**: Links in image maps (`<area>`) no longer keep `window.opener`
- **Mail**: A `mailto:` unsubscribe goes to the single address in the link, and the confirmation shows recipient, subject and body before sending
- **Mail**: A crafted `winmail.dat` no longer freezes the tab
- **Composer**: A sender name containing a quote can no longer add a recipient to a draft
- **Filters**: Rule names, header names and sizes are escaped, so rules from plugins or imported filter sets cannot add commands such as `redirect` to the Sieve script
- **Plugins**: Hooks and slots need a declared permission, like the host API does. `http.post` can no longer reach the JMAP passthrough, `/api/admin/*`, `/api/settings` or other credentialed routes, and plugin storage is kept per account and deleted on sign-out
- **Themes**: The theme CSS sanitizer no longer lets remote resources through (`url(//host)`, CSS escapes, `image-set()`, `@font-face` sources), and theme CSS can only target `:root` and `.dark`, also when a plugin transforms it
- **Files**: WOPI file downloads are always served as inert attachments, so a blob typed `text/html` cannot run script in the webmail origin
- **Server**: The SSRF guard also blocks loopback beyond `127.0.0.1`, CGNAT, benchmark, multicast and reserved ranges, and NAT64, 6to4 and Teredo addresses that wrap an internal IPv4 address. Telemetry targets are checked at connect time, and OAuth token and revocation requests never follow redirects
- **Auth**: Synced settings are keyed on the account a bearer token belongs to, so on a multi-domain server `john@b.example` can no longer read the settings of `john@a.example`
- **Auth**: Wrong passwords tried through the login pre-check are limited, so the route can no longer be used as a password oracle or trip Stalwart's ban against the webmail itself
- **Auth**: Signing out ends office editor sessions opened in that browser, and a full sign-out clears search history, open tabs, Files recents, staged plugin uploads and the other accounts' leftovers, also in other open tabs
- **Auth**: Signing out when another account's restore had failed no longer leaves that account resumable
- **Auth**: The failed TOTP login no longer passes on a user-chosen server's error body
- **Server**: Visitors who are not signed in no longer get detailed health data, the pending advisory text, the plugin list, the full admin policy or every server's domain list
- **Server**: The setup token is passed in the URL fragment, so it stays out of access logs, referers and history
- **Server**: Not-found pages outside the app tree cannot be framed, `ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTORS` never applies to the admin dashboard or setup, and sibling subdomains can no longer widen the sidebar-app `frame-src`
- **Server**: Favicons are only served as raster images
- **Docker**: Runtime state and secrets (`data/`, `local-data/`, `.env`) stay out of the standalone build and the image, and the mock JMAP server can no longer be switched on in a release build
- **Lite**: Sign-out revokes the refresh token, and a failed token login no longer keeps the password in `sessionStorage`
- **Lite**: Every static page gets a CSP that allows only its own inline scripts, the Stalwart bundle refuses to run inside a foreign frame, and the Stalwart install instructions use a tagged release with a published `.sha256` instead of `releases/latest`

### Features

- **Calendar**: Tasks with a due date show in the month view (#1107)

### Changes

- **Plugins**: Hooks that change outgoing mail need `email:send`, and display takeovers need `email:render-takeover`. Plugins that don't declare them lose those hooks
- **Themes**: Theme CSS keeps only `:root` and `.dark` rules plus `@font-face`, `@keyframes`, `@media` and `@supports`. Every `url()` except a `#fragment` is removed
- **Admin**: Impersonated sessions end after 8 hours, and sessions minted by earlier versions are signed out
- **Server**: `/api/health?detailed=true` needs a session

### Fixes

- **Mail**: The inbox keeps rendering when a message has an unparsable date (#1099)
- **Mail**: A folder no longer switches back to the unified inbox while it loads (#1102, thanks @guisea)
- **Mail**: Replies in the unified inbox come from the identity of the account that received the mail (#1104)
- **Mail**: Mail deleted during a list refresh no longer reappears (#966)
- **Mail**: The message list no longer jumps while attachment chips load
- **Mail**: Scrolling the unified inbox, cross-account views, tag views and "All folders" search no longer skips messages
- **Mail**: A failed message-list read keeps the list on screen instead of showing an empty folder
- **Mail**: Marking read, starring, tagging, emptying a folder and cancelling a scheduled send report it when the server refuses them
- **Mail**: Tagging and pinning write only the keywords that change, so they no longer mark mail unread that was read on another device
- **Mail**: New mail and folder changes keep arriving for users with seven or more shared accounts
- **Send**: A dropped connection can no longer send a message twice
- **Send**: Undo and edit of a message sent from a group identity act in the group's own account
- **Composer**: A reply draft stays in its thread when it is re-opened or undone
- **Composer**: An open draft stays on its own account across an account switch
- **Accounts**: Quick account switches no longer mix up identities, so replies go out with the right From address
- **Accounts**: Folders, filters and the account security page no longer show the previous account's data after a switch
- **Accounts**: Settings sync turns back on after signing out of one of several accounts
- **Push**: A notification opens its message in the account it came from
- **Calendar**: Events you declined show struck through (#1110)
- **Calendar**: Daily recurring events keep going past a DST gap
- **Calendar**: iCal subscriptions stay with the login that created them, so refreshing or removing one no longer touches a calendar of another login
- **Auth**: SSO sign-in behind nginx no longer fails with a 502 when the cookies would overflow its header buffer (#1096)
- **Auth**: Sign-in and addresses work on internationalized domains (#1100)
- **Lite**: A rate-limited token endpoint no longer signs you out
- **i18n**: The dark/light mode titles and the "Themes" settings tab are translated in every language (#1105, #1106, thanks @dulinux), and so is the themes settings panel
- **i18n**: Updated Portuguese (Brazil) translation (#1106, thanks @dulinux)

## 1.11.0 (2026-09-23)

1.11.0 introduces **Bulwark Lite**, a static build of the webmail that runs without a Node server, and fixes many places where Bulwark and Stalwart disagreed about mail, filters, calendars, contacts and files. It contains everything from the three 1.11.0 betas. The `latest` Docker tag moves to this release.

### Features

- **Lite**: Bulwark Lite, a static build that talks to the JMAP server straight from the browser. `npm run build:lite` builds it, and every release ships `bulwark-lite-<version>.zip` for any static web host
- **Lite**: `bulwark-lite-stalwart.zip`, a Stalwart Application bundle that picks up its mount prefix at runtime, with OpenID Connect login
- **Lite**: Container image `ghcr.io/bulwarkmail/webmail-lite` (#1081)
- **Themes**: "Flat fields" theme
- **Calendar**: Attendees can answer a single occurrence of a recurring event (#1086)
- **Mail**: Office attachments open read-only in the document editor, straight from the message, when a WOPI editor is configured (#1047)
- **Push**: Optional inbox-only push notifications (#983, thanks @guisea)
- **Mail**: Toasts for mail actions that gave no feedback, and an "email sent" toast after immediate sends
- **Filters**: "Keep a copy" option for forward actions
- **Filters**: Per-rule "Also move messages marked as spam" option
- **Admin**: Login page toggles in admin settings for the version, the 2FA code option, the heading and the subtitle (#1068)
- **Navigation**: Deep links resolve to the local instance

### Changes

- **Auth**: Signing out of an SSO account also signs out of the identity provider when it advertises an `end_session_endpoint` (#905). Set `OAUTH_END_SESSION=false` to keep the provider session, for example when other apps share it, and `OAUTH_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI` to send users back to the webmail afterwards
- **Filters**: Move and copy rules leave mail that Stalwart marked as spam in Junk. Before, a rule such as "subject contains invoice" also collected phishing. "Keep" rules stay unguarded as the allow-list
- **Mail**: Search sends terms exactly as typed, without adding a prefix wildcard, in tag views too
- **Mail**: The message list loads attachment chips lazily, so large folders open faster (#1089)
- **Send**: Scheduled send is limited to 7 days, the most Stalwart accepts
- **UI**: Icon set migrated from Lucide to Tabler Icons
- **Docker**: Pre-releases no longer move the `latest` tags
- **Docs**: Most README details moved to the website docs, with new screenshots

### Fixes

- **Mail**: "All folders" search includes shared accounts (#1082)
- **Mail**: A search inside a tag view narrows the tag instead of replacing it (#1084, thanks @rotterp)
- **Mail**: Leaving an account drops a search folder scope that belongs to it (#1084, thanks @rotterp)
- **Mail**: A failed search shows an error instead of "No results found"
- **Mail**: In unified views, threads belong to the account that owns them (#1012, thanks @lucamzanon)
- **Mail**: A failed move between accounts no longer deletes the original
- **Mail**: "Mark all as read" marks every unread message instead of skipping pages past the first 500
- **Mail**: Mark as spam and not spam report moves the server refuses
- **Mail**: Unread-first order keeps bringing up unread mail past the first page
- **Mail**: The tag button in a row's hover actions opens the tag picker instead of clearing the message's tags (#1032, thanks @douwezijlstra-frl)
- **Mail**: Tag and tab counters no longer download every matching id
- **Mail**: Text in fixed-width tables wraps to the screen on iOS (#1020)
- **Mail**: Mail action toasts show again
- **Send**: A send the server refuses is reported as failed instead of sent. When only filing the sent copy fails, a warning says so, so the mail is not sent twice
- **Send**: A From override is also used as the envelope sender where the server accepts it. Where it doesn't, as on Stalwart, the composer says that the identity's address shows in the Return-Path (#1009)
- **Send**: Sending with an identity adds its Bcc addresses
- **Composer**: Attachments over the server's size limits are refused before upload
- **Composer**: A staged attachment is kept until its upload finishes
- **Filters**: Filters keep running while the auto-reply is on, and saving a filter no longer turns the auto-reply off
- **Filters**: "Mark read", "star" and "add label" reach mail that the same rule moves, and rules keep their target folder after it is renamed
- **Filters**: Forward actions respect the server's redirect limit (one on Stalwart) instead of being dropped without notice
- **Auto-reply**: A warning appears before saving an auto-reply that Stalwart would refuse as too long
- **Calendar**: Edits to a single occurrence stay on that occurrence and keep its details
- **Calendar**: Date ranges are queried in the right time zone, and long recurring series or more than 1000 events no longer leave the calendar incomplete
- **Calendar**: When the server refuses an event's invitations, you can save the event without sending them
- **Calendar**: Subscriptions that fail with "Not authenticated" name the cause, such as a mail server certificate the webmail server does not trust (#1073)
- **Calendar**: The subscription dialog no longer promises CalDAV URLs
- **Calendar**: The import dropdown opens above the day and week views (#1049)
- **Contacts**: Contacts with calendar, scheduling or free/busy links save, and cleared fields are cleared on the server
- **Contacts**: vCard import no longer sends fields Stalwart rejects and writes addresses in the RFC 9553 form
- **Contacts**: Deleting an address book that still holds contacts works
- **Files**: Every file is listed, even when the account has more than `maxObjectsInGet` (#1069)
- **Files**: Copying a folder copies its contents, and changes inside a shared drive go to the drive's account
- **Files**: An upload or new folder whose name is taken becomes "name (2)" instead of failing
- **Files**: Sharing works on Stalwart versions before 0.16.6
- **Files**: Names Stalwart refuses are caught before sending, uploads store an accepted variant, and Office files keep their MIME type on Stalwart 0.16.6 and later
- **Account**: You stay signed in after changing your password in settings
- **Account**: Users who are not admins see their name, and changing the password or turning TOTP off asks for the current code
- **Auth**: OAuth endpoints on the configured issuer's own host are accepted when they resolve to a private address, so split-DNS setups no longer need `OAUTH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS` (#1028)
- **Auth**: Linking the mobile app re-authenticates against the account's own identity provider when OAuth is configured per server
- **Push**: Push subscriptions are renewed before Stalwart's 7-day expiry, so a tab or app left open for over a week keeps getting notifications
- **Sharing**: Principals are listed in directories with more than 500 users
- **Lite**: The login page hides the server field once `config.json` sets `jmapServerUrl` (#1087)
- **Plugins**: The plugin sandbox follows the app's "Automatic" language (#976, thanks @bartfaizoli76)
- **UI**: The global error page loads the app's styles

### Security

This release fixes six vulnerabilities reported by Jan Kahmen (turingpoint). Please update.

- **Mail**: HTML mail could run script in the webmail origin. `cid:` references were rewritten to `blob:` URLs that kept the sender's `Content-Type`, and the reverse proxy skipped every security header — CSP included — on app paths whose last segment contains a dot, although the signed-in mail, calendar, contacts and files routes render there. Blob URLs are now retyped as inert, link clicks from the message frame are gated by scheme, and the proxy only skips headers for an explicit static-asset allowlist (GHSA-xvjh-v9c6-qcvc, thanks @kah-ja)
- **Auth**: `POST /api/auth/session` and `POST /api/auth/stalwart-context` minted identity cookies without checking the supplied credentials against the JMAP server, so anyone could obtain a cookie for an arbitrary username and read that user's server-side settings. Credentials are now verified upstream before a cookie is issued: Basic credentials are bound to the account they authenticate, Bearer tokens to the session's username and identity. Deployments whose webmail container cannot reach the JMAP server no longer receive identity cookies, so cross-device settings sync stops working there (GHSA-wxcm-j4jc-9fxq, thanks @kah-ja)
- **Plugins**: The `/plugin-sandbox` runtime trusted whichever window posted the first message, so a foreign site could `window.open()` it, post its own `init`, and run code under the route's `unsafe-eval` CSP in the app origin — with or without plugins enabled. The sandbox now only accepts its framing window, and the proxy refuses to serve the route outside an iframe or when plugins are disabled (GHSA-96cx-gx36-3g79, thanks @kah-ja)
- **Auth**: Encrypted payloads now carry a purpose, so a WOPI editor access token can no longer be presented as a `jmap_stalwart_ctx` session cookie (GHSA-cqqx-mjcf-mh55, thanks @kah-ja)
- **Auth**: Reject cross-site requests to `/api/auth/*`. A malicious page could `POST` the victim's browser into an attacker-controlled account (session fixation) (GHSA-qvr9-m8cq-7wvg, thanks @kah-ja)
- **Mail**: Strip CR/LF and other control characters from the header values of generated read receipts. A crafted, RFC 2047-encoded subject could inject additional headers into the receipt (GHSA-w38p-hpqv-g89c, thanks @kah-ja)
- **Auth / Branding**: Pin the resolved IP at connect time for stored custom JMAP endpoints and branding URLs too, closing the DNS-rebinding gap left after GHSA-24w9-8r42-8jwm

### Features

- **Search**: Global search across mail, contacts, calendar and files — query parser, ranking and cross-account providers, a search palette, and a search tab in the Pro shell with avatars, tinted icons and structured previews (#641); hits open through the owning login on every surface (#847)

### Security

- **Calendar / Auth**: Pin the resolved IP address at socket-connect time when fetching caller-supplied URLs (iCalendar subscriptions, JMAP login and TOTP token-exchange servers). The public-host check used to run before `fetch()` opened its socket, so an attacker who controlled DNS for a hostname could rebind it to loopback, RFC-1918 or cloud-metadata addresses between the check and the connect and read up to 10 MB of the internal response through the unauthenticated `/api/fetch-ical` endpoint. Redirect targets are now validated the same way (GHSA-24w9-8r42-8jwm, thanks @Tike00)

### Features

- **Push**: Re-sync existing push registrations in the background on app start, so registrations created before the delivery filter existed — or whose Junk mailbox id went stale — get repaired without re-enabling notifications

### Fixes

- **Push**: Stop sending notifications for spam — the push subscription now carries a JMAP `emailPush` delivery filter that excludes `$junk` and the Junk mailbox (needs a server advertising the `emailPush` capability, e.g. Stalwart ≥ 0.16.16; older servers keep the previous behaviour)

### Fixes

## 1.8.1 (2026-08-07)

A GitHub Actions incident left the 1.8.0 release build queued indefinitely, so no Docker image was ever published for that tag. 1.8.1 re-runs the release with the same code, plus one plugin slot that merged in the meantime.

## 1.7.6 (2026-06-28)

### Breaking Changes

- **S/MIME**: The built-in S/MIME implementation has been removed from core and re-delivered through the new generic crypto plugin hooks (privileged same-origin plugin tier). S/MIME signing, encryption, decryption, certificate management, and the related settings UI now live in a plugin rather than the main app. Deployments that relied on built-in S/MIME must install the S/MIME crypto plugin to retain those features.

- **Mail**: Resolve destination account id to the local namespace on cross-account mailbox drop

## 1.7.0 (2026-05-21)

> **New: Pro mode (experimental).** Opt-in tabbed multi-pane interface for power users. Open multiple mail, calendar, contacts, and file views side-by-side, drag tabs to reorder or split panes at the edges, and work across all logged-in accounts in one shell - cross-account email moves, a unified inbox with search, account-split calendar/contacts/files sidebars, and a per-account "From" dropdown in the composer. Enable from Settings → Appearance; the `proInterface` preference is per-device and not synced.

### Breaking Changes

- **Plugins**: Plugins now run inside a null-origin iframe sandbox and talk to the host over a postMessage RPC bridge. The in-process plugin runtime is gone; the bundled in-tree plugins have been migrated. Third-party plugins built against the old in-process API need to be ported to the sandboxed runtime.
- **Plugins**: Server-managed bundles must be Ed25519-signed by the host and approved by an admin before they load. The host public key is served from `/api/plugin-signing-pubkey` and each bundle response carries the signature in the `X-Bundle-Signature` header. User-uploaded bundles still load unsigned, but managed marketplace and dev-folder bundles do not.
- **Plugins**: `bundleHash` is now a full SHA-256 over the bundle. Legacy short hashes are migrated on first load; any out-of-band tooling that pinned the old hash format needs to be updated.

### Features

- **Pro**: Tabbed shell with drag-to-reorder, drag-to-edge to split, side-by-side panes, and pane-aware responsive layout with a scoped sidebar overlay
- **Pro**: Auto-redirect to the Pro shell when Pro mode is on; `proInterface` is kept per-device instead of syncing
- **Pro**: Multi-account mail sidebar with client routing and a per-account mailbox cache
- **Pro**: Unified mailbox always visible, with full-text search
- **Pro**: Cross-account email moves
- **Pro**: Multi-account calendar sidebar split into owned vs shared per account

## 1.6.4 (2026-05-11)

### Web Setup Wizard

First-launch web setup wizard. New installs no longer need to hand-edit `.env.local` - point a browser at the container and the wizard probes the JMAP server(s), configures OAuth/OIDC, generates the session secret, accepts branding uploads, and provisions the initial admin password. Admin storage is now split into `ADMIN_CONFIG_DIR` (operator-authored, mountable read-only after setup) and `ADMIN_STATE_DIR` (runtime audit log and login timestamps); the legacy `ADMIN_DATA_DIR` keeps working for existing installs.

## 1.5.3 (2026-04-28)

> **New:** Help shape Bulwark Webmail. Each instance now sends a lightweight daily heartbeat (version, platform, bucketed account counts, feature toggles - never message data or PII) so we can see which platforms and features actually get used and prioritize fixes where they matter most. You're in control: opt out any time from **Admin → Telemetry** or by setting `BULWARK_TELEMETRY=off`. Full schema in the [privacy notice](https://bulwarkmail.org/docs/legal/privacy/telemetry).

### Features

- **Telemetry**: Anonymous instance telemetry, on by default. Reports schema version, platform, bucketed account counts, and feature toggles only - disable from the admin UI, with `BULWARK_TELEMETRY=off`, or by clearing the endpoint
- **Telemetry**: Track unique logins (HMAC'd per instance, 90-day retention) so the heartbeat can report bucketed account totals without storing usernames
- **Plugins**: Theme API v2 with token compiler and skin slot
- **Plugins**: Extension preview page and detailed extension info API
- **Calendar**: Right-click context menu on empty calendar space
- **Docker**: Persistent named volume for telemetry data so the instance id and admin's consent choice survive container upgrades

### Fixes

- **Security**: Block telemetry endpoint from pointing at internal/loopback hosts (validation + DNS-rebind re-check at fetch time)
- **Security**: Harden plugin config, TOTP token exchange, and branding file serving
- **Mail**: Batch shortcuts now act on the multi-selection when one is present (#228)

## 1.5.2 (2026-04-27)

### Features

- **Plugins**: New `composer-sidebar` slot and `ui:composer-sidebar` permission - plugins can now render a panel on either side of the New Message dialog. See `repos/subway-surfers` for an example
- **Plugins**: Manifests can declare `frameOrigins` - a strictly-validated list of `https://host` origins the plugin needs to embed. The proxy reads the union from enabled plugins and merges it into the host CSP `frame-src`, so the host CSP no longer needs to know about specific embed providers
- **Calendar/Contacts**: JMAP sharing for calendars and address books
- **i18n**: Czech language support

### Fixes

- **Security**: Validate URLs before outbound fetch
- **Calendar**: Prevent drag creation on touch events in the time grid

## 1.5.0 (2026-04-22)

### Breaking Changes

- **Self-service portal now needs Stalwart 0.16+**: Stalwart dropped its self-service HTTP API in 0.16.0 and replaced it with JMAP. Bulwark Webmail only talks to the new JMAP endpoint, so the self-service portal (account settings, app passwords, API keys) requires Stalwart 0.16 or newer. `STALWART_API_URL` is deprecated, these actions go through the normal JMAP session.

### Features

- **Stalwart**: Migrate Stalwart management API to JMAP `x:` methods for Stalwart 0.16

- **Contacts**: Revamp contact detail view with filters, photo, print, and duplicate actions
